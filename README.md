BlockDoc â€” A Secure Blockchain-Based Healthcare Document Management System
============================================================================


Problem Statement
-----------------
Healthcare institutions face critical challenges in managing and securing sensitive patient records, diagnostic reports, and medical histories. Most existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems rely on centralized databases, making them vulnerable to:

- Data breaches  
- Unauthorized access  
- Accidental loss

Additionally, manual processes for:
- Document verification  
- Inter-hospital data sharing  
- Patient consent management  

...are inefficient, error-prone, and lack transparency.


Significance of the Problem
----------------------------
**Data Integrity & Accuracy**
Timely and accurate access to medical data is vital for effective treatment. Any compromise can lead to misdiagnosis, treatment delays, or patient privacy violations.

**Privacy & Compliance**  
Healthcare providers must comply with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Current systems often lack auditability, exposing institutions to legal and ethical risks.

**Administrative Overload**  
Manual handling of documents and claims increases costs and decreases operational efficiency.

**Urgent Need**  
A decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent system is essential to ensure:
- Secure access  
- Regulatory compliance  
- Smooth collaboration between doctors, patients, and insurers


Introducing BlockDoc
---------------------
BlockDoc is a blockchain-powered document management system, offered as both a SaaS and standalone product, designed to solve the most pressing issues in healthcare data management.

It enables:
- Secure, immutable storage and sharing  
- Patient-controlled data access  
- Interoperability among hospitals, labs, insurance firms, and patients

Technologies used include:
- Blockchain for document integrity  
- Smart contracts for automation  
- AI-driven biometric verification  
- IPFS for decentralized storage

Core Features
--------------
**Dual Blockchain System**  
- Ethereum blockchain stores hashes of encrypted medical documents  
- Incentivization chain issues BDC (BlockDoc Coin) rewards for valid interactions

**IPFS + Smart Contracts**  
- Secure document storage using IPFS  
- Automates consent, verification, claims, and access via smart contracts

**Role-Based Access + Biometric-AI Verification**  
- Access differentiated by roles (doctor, patient, insurer)  
- AI model verifies biometric metadata for access control

**AES-256 Encrypted IPFS Storage**  
- Documents are encrypted before being stored on IPFS

**Full Document Traceability**  
- All actions (view, upload, approve) are timestamped and immutably logged

**LLM-Powered Chatbot**  
- AI assistant helps users retrieve records and understand medical terms

**Sepolia Test Network**  
- Affordable and secure smart contract testing before Ethereum mainnet deployment
