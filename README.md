Healthcare institutions often face significant challenges in managing and safeguarding sensitive patient records, diagnostic reports and medical histories. Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems typically rely on centralized databases, making them vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access and accidental loss. Additionally, manual processes for document verification, inter-hospital data sharing and patient consent management are inefficient, prone to errors and lack transparency.
Significance of the Problem:
Data Integrity & Accuracy: Accurate and timely access to medical records is essential for effective treatment and patient safety. Any compromise can lead to misdiagnosis, delays, or privacy breaches.
Privacy & Compliance: Healthcare providers must meet strict data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR). Existing systems often lack proper auditability, risking legal and ethical violations.
Administrative Overload: Manual handling of documents and claims increases costs and reduces operational efficiency.
Urgent Need for Secure Systems: The industry needs a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent solution that ensures secureccess, regulatory compliance, and smooth collaboration among doctors, patients, and insurers. 

The healthcare industry faces critical challenges in secure patient data management, document authenticity, and interoperability across institutions. Medical records, diagnostic reports, prescriptions, insurance claims and clinical trial data are often fragmented, tampered with or inaccessible, leading to delayed treatments, billing errors, and data breaches. Patients also often fail to access their own EHR’s.
BlockDoc is a blockchain-based document management system designed as a SaaS as well as a standalone product to address these issues by ensuring secure, immutable and transparent storage, access and verification of healthcare documents. It also leverages a dual blockchain architecture, smart contracts, biometric-AI verification and IPFS decentralized storage to create a secure ecosystem for healthcare document management. It allows hospitals, clinics, labs, insurance firms and patients to interact in a trustless, transparent and secure digital environment.
By using blockchain to store document hashes and control access, while also incentivizing participation through our very own crypto token (BlockDoc Coin - BDC), the platform ensures data integrity, enhanced access control, faster interoperability and compliance with health data regulations. 

Core functionalities:
Dual Blockchain Architecture:
  Medical Record Hashing: Ethereum-based blockchain stores hashes of encrypted documents.
  Incentivization Chain: A secondary blockchain manages reward distribution using BDC tokens.
IPFS & Smart Contracts: Automate patient consent, document upload, verification, insurance claim submission and provider access. IPFS for decentralized storage.
Role-Based Access & Biometric Security: Access restricted based on role (doctor, patient and insurer) and Integrated AI model verifies biometric metadata before granting document access.
AES-256 Encrypted Storage on IPFS: Medical documents stored securely and redundantly in a decentralized fashion.
Document Traceability: Every interaction with a document (view, upload, approval) is timestamped and logged immutably.
AI-Powered Support Chatbot and summarization: LLM-based assistant guides users (patients or providers) in retrieving documents and understanding medical terminology.
Sepolia-Based Smart Contract Testing: Enables affordable and secure development/testing before deployment on Ethereum mainnet.

benefits:
Automate Security & Integrity: Every document’s hash is permanently stored on blockchain—any tampering is instantly detectable.
Data Privacy: Role-based access + AES256 encryption ensures that sensitive health records remain protected from unauthorized users.
Transparency & Accountability: Complete audit trail for each document; who accessed it, when and what was done.
Faster Treatment & Claims: Providers and insurers access authenticated documents instantly, reducing delays in approvals and claims.
Interoperability Across Systems: Decentralized architecture ensures seamless integration between hospitals, labs and insurance databases.
Patient Empowerment: Patients control access to their records and earn tokens (BDC) when opting to share anonymized data for research.
Scalability & Cost-Efficiency: IPFS + blockchain ensures minimal reliance on centralized servers, reducing infrastructure and security costs.
Business Viability: The BDC token creates a sustainable model with B2B (hospital networks, insurance firms) and B2C (patients, caregivers) opportunities.

Tech Stack
Purpose and Benefits:
Python + Flask + SQLite:Handles all backend operations, including user authentication, biometric verification using AI models, and document metadata storage—enabling seamless and secure user interactions.
Solidity + Ethereum + Web3:Core to the solution’s transparency and security. Smart contracts ensure automated, tamper-proof actions for document handling and reward issuance, while Ethereum guarantees immutability.
Ganache + MetaMask:Ganache allows safe testing of blockchain logic locally, and MetaMask enables secure, user-friendly blockchain interaction, reducing entry barriers for non-technical users.
HTML/CSS/JS + Bootstrap:Provides an intuitive and accessible interface where users can upload, retrieve, and track healthcare documents effortlessly, promoting usability and adoption.
